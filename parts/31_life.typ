= Life

If I could walk right beside you

Show you just who I am

You know, I would

The memories we made, fade

I realize we'll never be the same

Why can't you see my view?

Eye to eye, what's fake, what's true

#bigskip()

You go on and grow

Pass by all that I've known and I'm left here all alone

Recycled thoughts I'm fed

Keep racing in my head till

There's nowhere left to go

#bigskip()

Waiting here for you

What am I to do, what am I to do when you're gone?

When you'rе gone, when you're gonе

End is overdue

Voices calling to, voices that I knew all along

When you're gone

My hands reach up onto my face and I don't feel a thing

And I never realized the pain

This thing I call life

#bigskip()

Life and these lies

#bigskip()

And everyday I'm changing and my thoughts keep rearranging

I don't know if it's all real or fiction

My memory is hazy, can't be sure if what I'm thinking's a lie

Don't let me go, I can't go

#bigskip()

You go on and grow pass

By all that I've known and I'm left here all alone

Recycled thoughts I'm fed

Keep racing in my head till

There's nowhere left to go

#bigskip()

I'm always

Waiting here for you

What am I to do, what am I to do when you're gone?

When you're gone, when you're gone

End is overdue

Voices calling to, voices that I knew all along

When you're gone

My hands reach up onto my face and I don't feel a thing

And I never realized the pain

This thing I call life

#bigskip()

I'm fighting just to find

You, I found you. Again. Hello.

#bigskip()

Waiting here for you

What am I to do, what am I to do when you're gone?

When you're gone, when you're gone

End is overdue

Voices calling to, voices that I knew all along

When you're gone

My hands reach up onto my face and I don't feel a thing

And I never realized the pain

This thing I call life
