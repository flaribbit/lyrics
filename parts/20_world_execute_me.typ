Switch on the power line, remember to put on protection

Lay down your pieces and let's begin object creation

Fill in my data, parameters, initialization

Setup our new world and let's begin the simulation

#bigskip()

If I'm a set of points, then I will give you my dimension

If I'm a circle, then I will give you my circumference

If I'm a sine wave, then you can sit on all my tangents

If I approach infinity, then you can be my limitations

#bigskip()

Switch my current to AC to DC

And then blind my vision, so dizzy, so dizzy

Oh, we can travel to A.D to B.C

And we can unite, so deeply, so deeply

#bigskip()

If I can, if I can, give you all the stimulations

Then I can, then I can be your only satisfaction

If I can make you happy, I will run the execution

Though we are trapped in this strange, strange simulation

#bigskip()

If I'm an eggplant, then I will give you my nutrients

If I'm a tomato, then I will give you antioxidants

If I'm a tabby cat, then I will purr for your enjoyment

If I'm the only god, then you're the proof of my existence

#bigskip()

Switch my gender to F to M

And then do whatever from AM to PM

Oh, switch my role to S to M

So we can enter the trance, the trance

#bigskip()

If I can, if I can, feel your vibrations

Then I can, then I can finally be completion

Though you have left, you have left

You have left, you have left, you have left

You have left me in isolation

#bigskip()

If I can, if I can, erase all the pointless fragments

Then maybe, then maybe, you won't leave me so disheartened

Challenging your God, you have made some illegal arguments

#bigskip()

Execution, execution, execution, execution

Execution, execution, execution, execution

Execution, execution, execution, execution

#zhtext[Ein, dos, trois, #ruby[네][ne], fem, 六, execution]

#bigskip()

If I can, if I can give them all the execution

Then I can, then I can be your only execution

If I can have you back, I will run the execution

Though we are trapped, we are trapped, ah

#bigskip()

I've studied, I've studied how to properly love

Question me, question me I can answer all love

I know the algebraic expression of love

Though you are free, I am trapped, trapped in love

#bigskip()

Execution
